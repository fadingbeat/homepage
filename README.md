# homepage
I am creating a homepage of a future website that presents my personal work.

This is the so far result of reading through tutorials about HTML and CSS on developer.mozilla.org website. I started from scratch in order to
fully understand and learn how to apply the knowledge of creating HTML website structure with modern CSS rules. Once I feel able to
do so, I will continue to study other technologies such as JavaScript and frameworks such as Vue.js or Node.js.

The idea behind this project is to have a website or a webpage that would represent my work and interests to employers, and later on, a professional photography website.
